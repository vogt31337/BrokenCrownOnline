BrokenCrownOnline
=================

Broken Crown Online is an online turn based combat game with a rich economy simulation and a big background story.
Main idea is to develop an open source online tool which will enhance the game experience of the Live Action Role Play (LARP) of Broken Crown.
More Information about this LARP can be found here (german only): http://broken-crown.de/index.php

Philosophy
==========

Broken Crown is a LARP which is based on a rich but closed World. Many participants like this style of role play, but they are demanding for more.
So we initiated a new project to give these people a way to interact with the world outside of the main events.
Also we want to be able to control what's happening in this off time simulation and we also want to be able to derive events and situations for upcoming events.
